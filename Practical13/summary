Human SOD2 Protein Characteristics
The human SOD2 protein has 222 amino acids in length and is subcellularly localised in the mitochondrion matrix. 
This localisation is crucial as it allows the protein to perform its function of scavenging superoxide radicals within the mitochondria, an organelle where a significant amount of reactive oxygen species are generated during normal cellular metabolism.

Result
Online BLAST Results: For the human SOD2 protein query against the UniProt database with the BLAST search restricted to Eutheria, 1445 hits were obtained. 
The range of percentage identity among the retrieved alignments was from 58.1% to 100%.  
This range indicates the degree of sequence similarity between the human SOD2 protein and other homologous proteins in the database. 
A wider range might suggest a diverse evolutionary history with some proteins being more distantly related while others are closer in sequence.
The alignment with the mouse SOD2 protein (UniProt ID: P09671) had a percentage identity of 90.1%.

Python Alignment Results:
Human - Mouse Comparison: The alignment score was 1097, and the percentage of identical amino acids was 90.09%.
Human - Random Comparison: The alignment score was -241, and the percentage of identical amino acids was 4.95%.
Mouse - Random Comparison: The alignment score was -240, and the percentage of identical amino acids was 4.95%.

Sequence Relationship
Based on the alignment scores and percentages of identical amino acids, the human and mouse SOD2 sequences are most closely related. 
The high alignment score and percentage of identical amino acids between them, compared to the results involving the random sequence, indicate a shared evolutionary origin. This close relationship is consistent with the fact that humans and mice are both mammals and likely have conserved functional regions in the SOD2 protein to carry out essential antioxidant functions.
